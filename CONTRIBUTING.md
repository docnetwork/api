# Using Issues

Currently, we accept three types of issues:

1. Bugs
2. Enhancements
3. Questions

## Bugs

File a bug when the behavior of the API deviates from documented (or expected) behavior.

**NOTE: If you're having trouble making a specific request, DO NOT post the full details of that request. Developers from other organizations are able to see every issue.  Instead, it is safe to post the `X-Request-Identifier` header from the response.  Our team will be able to examine the request in our logs.  You may also contact our team directly.**

## Enhancements

We've launched the API with a limited number of features, with the expectation that functionality will grow over time.  We'll prioritize new features on discussions within `enhancement` issues.

## Questions

For general questions that aren't necessarily a `bug` or an `enhancement`.
